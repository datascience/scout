      <h1>About</h1>
       <p class="lead">An important part of digital preservation is to analyse the content and uncover the risks that hinder its preservation. This analysis entails answering diverse questions, like for example: <i>Which file formats do I have?</i>, <i>Are there any invalid files?</i>, <i>Are there any files violating my defined policies?</i>; and many others. The threats to preservation of content belong to many distinct domains, from technological to organizational, economical and political, and can relate to the holder of the content, the producers or to the target communities to which the content is primarily destined for.</p>

      <p class="lead"><a href="http://openplanets.github.io/scout/">Scout</a>, the preservation watch system, allows to centralize all the necessary knowledge to the same platform, cross-relating this knowledge to uncover all preservation risks. Scout automatically fetches information from several sources to populate its knowledge base. For example, SCOUT integrates with <a href="http://peshkira.github.io/c3po/">C3PO</a> to get large-scale characterization profiles of content. Furthermore, Scout targets to be a knowledge exchange platform, to allow the community to bring together all the necessary information into the system. The sharing of information opens new opportunities for joining forces against common problems.</p>

<p class="lead">This tutorial demonstrates and provides a hands-on on how to find preservation risks in your content and, at the same time, share your content profile information with others to open new opportunities.</p>


<p class="lead palette palette-alizarin">We encourage all participants to bring their own content and laptops, and learn how to uncover preservation risks hands on!</p>
